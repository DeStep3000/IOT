CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findqt-everywhere-src-6.6.2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "qt-everywhere-src-6.6.2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "qt-everywhere-src-6.6.2" with any of the following names:

    qt-everywhere-src-6.6.2Config.cmake
    qt-everywhere-src-6.6.2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "qt-everywhere-src-6.6.2" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "qt-everywhere-src-6.6.2_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "qt-everywhere-src-6.6.2" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
